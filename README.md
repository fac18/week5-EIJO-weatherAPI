Getting Travis set-up: realised very soon we needed the owner to authorise travis on the repo, but once it was set-up if you had a travis account you could see all the repos you're apart of.

- so technically you can spy on other people's builds

---

We got it set up on Slack so that we were notified at each build even if you don't have a travis account and dashboard

- add app in slack (takes you to slack site)
- choose channel for notifications
- add code to .travis.yml file

```json=
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "node"
notifications:
  slack: foundersandcoders:vCDquX9W7QOCHGAQzf3esLif
  ```

- By the end of day 1 we had our CSS and HTML sorted and a skeleton for building the API.
- And so we started day two very positive: let's do two api calls!
- both calls were working but we could only send an ugly object to the front end
- we also hit our limit on the tfl api at 3pm
- for three hours we wrestled with this problem - why was an object being sent (making a new page with it's contents) but our console.logs in the api call weren't working??

### Las lecciones:

- add your front end js to your html!!!! üí°
- try to rewrite rather than take legacy code from other projects
- console.log everything
